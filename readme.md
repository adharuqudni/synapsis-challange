# People Tracking System

## üìå Overview

This project implements a **real-time people tracking system** using YOLO for object detection and BoT-SORT for multi-object tracking. The system captures video from an **HLS CCTV stream**, processes it with deep learning models, and sends metadata and frames to the frontend for visualization. The goal is to track and count people within a **polygonal area**, monitoring entries and exits.

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ **Database Design** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- Designed and implemented relational tables for **People and Events**.
- Currently, the system supports a **single polygon (Area)**, but future improvements may introduce multiple dynamic areas.

### ‚úÖ **Dataset Collection** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- Live video feed streamed from **HLS CCTV Yogyakarta**.
- Example source: [Malioboro CCTV](https://cctvjss.jogjakota.go.id/malioboro/Malioboro_2_Depan_Toko_Subur.stream/playlist.m3u8).

### ‚úÖ **Object Detection & Tracking** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- **YOLO v11** for **object detection**.
- **BoT-SORT** for **multi-object tracking (MOT)**.

### ‚úÖ **Counting & Polygon Area Processing** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- **Single polygon supported** (for now).
- Two key tracking features implemented:
  1. **Counting People Inside the Polygon**
     - A person is counted as "inside" if their bounding box **intersects** with the polygon.
     - Future improvement: Improve classification of people "inside" based on movement patterns.
  2. **Entry & Exit Counting Logic**
     - **Entry**: If a person was **never inside before** and moves inside, the **entry counter increases**.
     - **Exit**: If a person was **previously inside** and moves outside, the **exit counter increases**.

### ‚úÖ **Prediction Model** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- Current best-performing model: **YOLO v11n** (optimized for real-time processing).
- Built-in tracker: **BoT-SORT** (default in YOLO v11).
- Future improvements:
  - Train a custom model to **better distinguish people** in crowded environments.
  - Enhance **multi-object tracking (MOT)** for more accurate ID persistence.

### ‚úÖ **API & Frontend Integration** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js**.
- **Backend**: Powered by **FastAPI**.
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - **HTTP** for API calls.
  - **WebSocket** for real-time streaming of frames & metadata.
- **Database**: Using **SQLite** for storage.
- **Live status API**:
  - Returns real-time metadata updates via **WebSocket**.
  - Provides **historical data** (last **5 minutes**) of people **inside and outside the area**.
- **Future Improvement**:
  - Support **multiple polygon areas** instead of a single area.

### ‚úÖ **Deployment** (‚úîÔ∏è Done)

- Deployed using **Docker Compose**.
- Supports **both ARM64 and x86 architectures**:
  - `docker-compose.yaml` ‚Üí for **ARM64**.
  - `docker-compose-86.yaml` ‚Üí for **x86**.

## ‚úÖ **Challenges Accomplished**  
1. **Focusing on Core Functionalities First**  
   - Object detection, tracking, and counting were prioritized over additional features.  
   - Ensured a **fully working backend** before integrating a frontend or dashboard.  

2. **Handling Real-Time Video Processing**  
   - Successfully **streamed HLS CCTV** video input.  
   - Optimized **YOLO v11n + BoT-SORT** to maintain a good **FPS for real-time processing**.  

3. **Implementing Entry-Exit Logic**  
   - Developed a **robust tracking system** to count people **entering and exiting** an area.  
   - Designed **logic to determine if a person is inside the polygon** dynamically.  

4. **WebSocket Integration for Live Updates**  
   - Implemented a **WebSocket-based** real-time streaming system.  
   - Ensured **frontend updates instantly** when a person enters/exits the area.  

5. **Efficient Data Storage & Retrieval**  
   - Optimized database schema to **store logs efficiently**.  
   - Designed API endpoints to **return real-time and historical data** effectively.  

6. **Docker Deployment & Multi-Arch Support**  
   - Successfully containerized the system with **Docker Compose**.  
   - Added support for **both AMD64 and x86 architectures**.  

7. **Developing a Web-Based Dashboard (Bonus Feature)**  
   - Created a **Next.js dashboard** to visualize tracking results.  
   - Integrated **real-time video and metadata** display on the frontend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Improvements  

### üõ† **Potential Improvements**  
1. **Multi-Area Support**: Implement multiple polygon areas instead of a single predefined area.  
2. **Improved Classification of People Inside an Area**: Define better logic for detecting people "inside" an area based on their movement.  
3. **Enhanced Multi-Object Tracking (MOT)**: Improve tracking persistence across frames.  
4. **Custom Model Training**: Train a YOLO model with **better person detection** for CCTV environments.  
5. **Scalability**: Support multiple camera feeds dynamically.
